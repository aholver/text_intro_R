# Next Steps in R Series (Virtual): Introduction to Text Analysis
 
Welcome to our virtual Introduction to Text Analysis in R. 

**Required installations**: Please make sure that you have R and RStudio installed on your computer before the workshop starts. Instructions for installation are here: https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/

Also, before the workshop, please install these packages: dplyr, ggplot2, quanteda, quanteda.textstats, quanteda.textplots, and quanteda.corpora. You can use the following code: 

```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "quanteda", "quanteda.textstats", "quanteda.textplots"))

devtools::install_github("quanteda/quanteda.corpora"). 
```

If you don't have devtools installed, you'll also need to run this code: 

```
install.packages("devtools"). 
```

If you have any issues installing these packages, please submit a consult request using this form at least 3 business days prior to the workshop.
